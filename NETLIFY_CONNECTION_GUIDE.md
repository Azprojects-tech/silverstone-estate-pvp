# 🚀 CONNECT NETLIFY TO GITHUB
## ifeanyiali - Silverstone Estate PVP

---

## ✅ COMPLETED SO FAR

✅ Your code is now on GitHub at:
```
https://github.com/Azprojects-tech/silverstone-estate-pvp
```

**What you'll see there:**
- `index.html` (your main portal)
- All documentation files
- All your project files

---

## 🎯 NEXT: CONNECT TO NETLIFY

We'll now make your portal LIVE by connecting Netlify to your GitHub repository.

**Time needed:** 5 minutes ⏱️

---

## STEP 1: OPEN NETLIFY

1. **Go to:** https://app.netlify.com/teams/ifeanyiali/projects

2. You should see your Netlify team dashboard

---

## STEP 2: ADD NEW SITE

**Look for one of these buttons:**
- "Add new site"
- "New site"  
- "Connect to Git"

**Click it**

(Usually in the top right or center of the page)

---

## STEP 3: CHOOSE GITHUB

You'll see options like:
- GitHub
- GitLab
- Bitbucket

**Click: GitHub**

---

## STEP 4: SELECT YOUR REPOSITORY

Netlify will show you a list of your GitHub repositories.

**Find:** `silverstone-estate-pvp`

**Click it**

---

## STEP 5: CONFIGURE SETTINGS

After selecting the repository, you'll see a form with these fields:

### **Branch to deploy:**
```
Should show: main
If not, change it to: main
```

### **Build command:**
```
Leave EMPTY (don't type anything)
This is a static site, no build needed
```

### **Publish directory:**
```
Should show: .
(just a dot)
If not, change it to: .
```

✅ Everything else can stay as default

---

## STEP 6: DEPLOY!

**Click the button:** "Deploy site"

⏳ **Wait 30-90 seconds**

You'll see:
- "Building..." (yellow/processing)
- Then "Published" (green checkmark) ✅

---

## STEP 7: GET YOUR LIVE URL

Once it shows "Published" in green:

**Look at the top of the page** - You'll see a URL like:

```
https://silverstone-estate-pvp.netlify.app
```

(or a randomly generated name)

**This is your LIVE portal URL!** 🎉

---

## STEP 8: TEST YOUR PORTAL

**Click on your URL to open it**

### Verify:
- [ ] Page loads (no errors)
- [ ] Map is visible with properties
- [ ] Can see property boundaries
- [ ] Click a property → shows price ₦3,000,000
- [ ] "Map" and "Satellite" toggle buttons work
- [ ] Admin panel shows 51 properties (bottom left)

**All working?** → Perfect! ✅

## STEP 9: COPY YOUR PORTAL URL

**Q: Netlify shows "Building..." for too long**
A: This is normal. Wait 2-3 minutes. Check the build logs if needed.

**Q: Portal shows 404 error**
A: Wait 2-3 minutes, then hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R on Windows)
